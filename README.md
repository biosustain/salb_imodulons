Salb-imodulons: A comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional regulatory network of *Streptomyces albidoflavus* J1074. iModulons are independently-modulated groups of genes that are computed through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of a gene expression dataset (see [here](https://github.com/avsastry/modulome-workflow/) for more details).

This repository presents a computational workflow to compute and characterize all iModulons for *S. albidoflavus*:

1. Process all available RNA-seq data.
2. Inspect data to identify high-quality datasets. 
3. Compute iModulons.
4. Characterize iModulons using PyModulon.

A pre-print is currently being prepared highlighting the results of this study.
